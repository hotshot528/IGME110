      Enjoyment/pleasure is the easiest to understand why it’s caused and why people play games, 
      it’s because games are naturally and designed to be fun. Humans seek enjoyment and fun, 
      games are designed specifically for that purpose and are even advertised that people 
      will like and spend time playing their game. The reason people do things that they enjoy 
      is because of dopamine. Dopamine is the chemical released from the reward system in our 
      brain to encourage us to take certain actions and seek certain things, originally this 
      was a defensive mechanism to teach our ancestors what to do in order to survive but has 
      since turned into our sense of fun and enjoyment.
