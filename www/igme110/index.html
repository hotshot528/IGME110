    <h2>
      I got into fencing when I was in 6th grade after learning about a club in my town run by my PE teacher, during my time at the club I managed to make it to the Junior Olympics twice(both times with a team and once alone). I tend to spend quite a lot of time playing video games, specifically Destiny, Persona, Fire Emblem, and Pokemon. I also enjoy puzzles normally in the form of escape rooms or puzzle games. Lastly I occasionally play D&amp;D with my friends whenever we can.
